# 505 React
## React Context API

Welcome 505 React peeps! This is a sample app that we'll be building together to demonstrate the React Context API.

### Setup

Clone repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:edelgado/react-505-context.git
```

Install dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

Move to starting point:
```
git checkout start
git checkout -b exercise
```

Run the app:
```
yarn run dev
```

### Troubleshooting

If you get stuck at any step in the exercise, you can catch up by moving to the code at a certain step:

```
git checkout step02
git checkout -b exercise-from-step02
```

Available steps are:
* `start`, `step01`, `step02`, `step03`, `step04`, `step05`.
